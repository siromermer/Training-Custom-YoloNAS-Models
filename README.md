Model file was to big for github . I will share it as drive link, and if you want to test model  you can download it and make predictions. <br>

Normally when you train a model with this pipeline  there is going to be directory like this one ----> checkpoints/yolonas-m-model-1--20epoch/RUN_20240928_092056_925759/average_model.pth <br>
I couldnt upload it because of the file size
